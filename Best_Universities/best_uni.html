        <h2>Harvard University</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 1636, Harvard University is the oldest higher education
          institution in the U.S. The bulk of Harvard's students study at the
          graduate level and more than 20 percent of the student body is
          international. Harvard is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but
          also has facilities such as the Harvard Medical School based in the
          nearby city of Boston. The university has the largest endowment of any
          school in the world. Harvard research takes place across a range of
          disciplines in more than 100 centers. The university is made up of the
          undergraduate college, as well as 11 other degree-granting
          institutions including the highly ranked Business School, Graduate
          School of Education, Law School and the John F. Kennedy School of
          Government. The medical school is affiliated with several teaching
          hospitals, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Brigham
          and Women’s Hospital. For Harvard undergraduates, the most popular
          majors include social sciences, biology/biological sciences, history,
          math and psychology. The university’s academic calendar is
          semester-based and English is the language of instruction. Most
          undergraduate students live on campus for all four years, first
          residing around the Harvard Yard at the center of campus as freshmen
          and then in one of 12 undergraduate houses for the duration of their
          studies. Some university housing is available for graduate students.
          The Harvard Library is the largest academic library in the world,
          boasting around 19 million volumes at its more than 70 libraries.

        <h2>Massachusetts Institute Of Technology</h2>
        <p>
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology, founded in 1861, is located in
          Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Boston. Around 11,000 students attend
          the university, with roughly 60 percent of them studying at the
          graduate level. MIT contains five schools: architecture and planning;
          engineering; humanities, arts, and social sciences; management; and
          science. English is the language of instruction at MIT. The academic
          calendar is a 4-1-4 system with a four-week "Independent Activities
          Period" in January. During this period, undergraduate and graduate
          students, faculty, staff and alumni participate in forums, lecture
          series, recitals and other special activities. First-year
          undergraduate students are the only ones required to live on campus
          but many students further along in their studies choose to reside on
          campus as well. There are many opportunities for both undergraduate
          and graduate students to gain research experience at one of MIT’s many
          labs or centers, including the MIT Nuclear Reactor Laboratory, one of
          the largest university research reactors in the U.S. Nearly 90 percent
          of MIT undergraduates participate in the school’s Undergraduate
          Research Opportunities Program, which partners students and faculty
          for research projects, by the time they graduate. More than $675
          million was spent on research at MIT in a recent year, with additional
          federal funding going to MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory, a Department of
          Defense research and development lab focused on technological
          solutions to national security issues. University Data

        <h2>Stanford University</h2>
        <p>
          Stanford University was founded in 1885 and is located in California’s
          Bay Area, around 30 miles south of San Francisco. More than half of
          the student body studies at the graduate level. Seven schools comprise
          the university, many of which are highly ranked for graduate-level
          studies. Three of the schools offer both undergraduate and graduate
          degrees: humanities and sciences; earth sciences; and engineering. The
          business, law, education and medical schools offer only graduate-level
          degrees. Stanford’s academic calendar is based on a quarter system and
          the language of instruction is English. Around 8 percent of the
          undergraduate student body is international, as is around 30 percent
          of the graduate student population. Housing is guaranteed for four
          years for undergraduates who enter as freshmen, and more than 90
          percent of undergrads live on campus. Stanford also guarantees
          first-year housing for new graduate students. More than 60 percent of
          graduate students live on campus, as well as around 30 percent of
          faculty members. Stanford’s library system, which supports 20
          libraries, comprises more than 9.3 million physical volumes. Research
          funding at Stanford has topped $1 billion, including funds from the
          federal government for projects at the SLAC National Accelerator
          Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy lab operated by Stanford.
          Scientists from all over the world - around 3,400 of them annually –
          take advantage of SLAC’s facilities. Upward of 1,000 scientific papers
          based on research conducted at the lab are published each year.

      <article id="Berkeley">
        <h2>University Of California - Berkeley</h2>
        <p>
          The University of California—Berkeley is situated roughly 15 miles
          from San Francisco in what is known as the Bay Area. The public
          university, also commonly known as Berkeley or Cal, was founded in
          1868. More than 70 percent of Berkeley students study at the
          undergraduate level. The university is divided into 14 colleges and
          schools, including the highly ranked Haas School of Business, College
          of Chemistry, College of Engineering, School of Public Health and
          School of Law. The academic calendar is semester-based and English is
          the language of instruction. UC—Berkeley offers students around 350
          degree programs. Some of the most popular majors for Berkeley
          undergraduates have included electrical engineering and computer
          science; economics; political science; business administration; and
          psychology. Around a quarter of undergraduate students live on campus,
          including some 95 percent of freshmen. Many graduate students live off
          campus, but they have the option to live in university-owned
          accommodations. Roughly 15 percent of the student body is
          international, and tuition and fees are higher for out-of-state
          students. Around 3,000 international scholars come to Berkeley each
          year in temporary teaching or research positions. Berkeley research is
          conducted not just within academic department labs and research
          centers but also in some of the school’s museums and
          university-managed biological field stations. Research in botany,
          zoology, ecosystems and forestry is undertaken at the remote field
          station sites. Berkeley researchers discovered several of the elements
          on the periodic table, including californium and berkelium.

        <h2>University of Oxford</h2>
        <p>
          The exact date of the University of Oxford’s founding is unknown, but
          the school traces its roots back to at least 1096. Oxford is located
          around 60 miles northwest of London, and around 45 percent of its
          student body is made up of graduate students. More than half of
          Oxford’s graduate students conduct research as part of their studies.
          Research at Oxford takes place in all four of its academic divisions:
          humanities; mathematical, physical and life sciences; medical
          sciences; and social sciences. Oxford’s academic calendar is divided
          into three terms - Michaelmas (fall), Hilary (spring) and Trinity
          (summer) - each eight weeks long. The language of instruction at the
          university is English. The University of Oxford is made up of a
          central university; 38 colleges; and six Permanent Private Halls,
          which tend to be smaller than colleges and offer fewer subjects. The
          colleges at Oxford are each equipped with a dining hall, common room
          and library. Undergraduates are guaranteed college housing for their
          freshman year and can often continue to live there during the later
          years of their studies. Graduate students are not guaranteed housing
          but some colleges may have space for them during their first year,
          especially for international students. Tuition costs are higher for
          non-European Union students. The university and its academic
          departments and colleges, as well as dozens of external organizations,
          have made more than 900 scholarships available for graduate students.
