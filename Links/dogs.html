    <h2>Amazing Facts About Dogs</h2>
    <h3>1. Their sense of smell is at least 40x better than ours</h3>
    <p>
      The area of cells in the brain that detect different smells is around 40
      times larger in dogs than humans. This means that your dog can pick up on
      way more smells than we ever could. This is why dogs are often used to
      sniff out people, drugs and even money!

    <h3>2. Some have such good noses they can sniff out medical problems</h3>
    <p>
      Yup, medical detection dogs are a thing. Because their sense of smell is
      so great, some dogs can be trained to sniff out medical conditions. They
      are used to diagnose a particular condition or to alert their owners if
      they need more medication. Some are even being trained to sniff out
      Covid-19!

    <h3>3. Some dogs are incredible swimmers</h3>
    <p>
      So, not all dogs like water, but the ones that do tend to be pretty good
      swimmers (but again, not all are so always keep an eye on your dog in case
      they decide to take a dip out and about).
