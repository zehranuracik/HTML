    <h1>TOP-RATED TOURİST ATTRACTİONS & THINGS TO DO IN ISTANBUL</h1>
    <h2>1.Admire the Hagia Sophia (Aya Sofya) Mosque</h2>
    <p>
      It's said that when the Byzantine Emperor Justinian entered his finished
      church for the first time in CE 536, he cried out
      <i
        >"Glory to God that I have been judged worthy of such a work. Oh
        Solomon, I have outdone you!"</i
      >
      The Hagia Sophia (Aya Sofya in Turkish) was the emperor's swaggering
      statement to the world of the wealth and technical ability of his empire.
      Tradition maintained that the area surrounding the emperor's throne within
      the church was the official center of the world. Through its conversion to
      a mosque, after the Ottoman armies conquered Constantinople, to its
      further conversion into a museum in the 20th century and its reconversion
      back into a working mosque in 2020, the Hagia Sophia has remained one of
      Istanbul's most cherished landmarks.

    <h2>Topkapı Palace (Topkapı Sarayı)</h2>
    <p>
      First built by Mehmet the Conqueror in the 15th century, this glorious
      palace beside the Bosphorus was where the sultans of the Ottoman Empire
      lived and ruled from. The vast complex is a dazzling display of Islamic
      art, with opulent courtyards lined with intricate hand-painted tilework,
      linking a warren of sumptuously decorated rooms, all bounded by
      battlemented walls and towers. Of the many highlights here, the most
      popular are the Harem complex (where the sultan's many concubines and
      children would spend their days); the Second Court, where you can walk
      through the vast palace kitchens and stand in awe at the dazzling interior
      of the Imperial Council Chamber; and the Third Court, which contained the
      sultan's private rooms. The Third Court also displays an impressive
      collection of relics of the Prophet Muhammad in the Sacred Safekeeping
      Room and is home to the Imperial Treasury, where you're greeted with a
      cache of glittering gold objects and precious gems that will make your
      eyes water. To fully see Topkapı Palace, you'll need at least half a day.

    <h2>Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmet Camii)</h2>
    <p>
      Sultan Ahmet I's grand architectural gift to his capital was this
      beautiful mosque, commonly known as the Blue Mosque today. Built between
      1609 and 1616, the mosque caused a furore throughout the Muslim world when
      it was finished, as it had six minarets (the same number as the Great
      Mosque of Mecca). A seventh minaret was eventually gifted to Mecca to stem
      the dissent. The mosque gets its nickname from its interior decoration of
      tens of thousands of Iznik tiles. The entire spatial and color effect of
      the interior makes the mosque one of the finest achievements of Ottoman
      architecture.
