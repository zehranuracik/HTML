    <h1>BEST MOVIES EVER</h1>
    <h2>Briedsmaids(2011)</h2>
    <p>
      Likely the funniest <i>—not to mention one of the most influential—</i>of
      all 21st-century motion pictures, <b><mark>Paul Feig</mark></b
      >'s uproarious, unflinching look at modern-age female friendship launched
      the film careers of <b><mark>Kristen Wiig</mark></b> and
      <b><mark>Melissa McCarthy</mark> </b> into the stratosphere. Audiences
      flocked to the picture in its initial run, and it only benefits from
      repeat viewings: this subject matter (women bonding in adulthood) is all
      but completely neglected in mainstream film, never this insightful or
      gut-bustlingly hilarious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imitators read <i>Bridesmaids’</i> success the wrong way: it wasn’t a
      hit because chicks were being vulgar
      <i>(although that was an incidental perk)</i>. Bridesmaids was a prolonged
      sensation at the box office because, for once, a mainstream comedy
      accurately depicted what happens in women’s social and personal lives.

    <h2>GOODFELLAS(1990)</h2>
    <p>
      An account of the rise and fall of mob associate <i>Henry Hill</i>
      <b><mark> (Ray Liotta)</mark></b> is such a masterpiece that upon its
      release, <b><mark>Rogert Ebert</mark></b> christened it the finest
      organized crime movie of all time, ahead of even <i>The Godfather</i>. Say
      no more. A key work of our finest living director, <i>Goodfellas</i> lost
      the Oscar for Best Picture to <i>Dances With Wolves</i> in an upset for
      the ages.
    </p>
    <h2>STAND BY ME(1985)</h2>
    <p>
      Based on the novella <i>The Body</i>, <b><mark>Rob Reiner</mark></b
      >'s touching coming-of-age classic centers on a group of boys in 1950s
      Oregon who go on a hike to find the body of another young kid. The
      realistic performances of young <b><mark>River Phoenix</mark></b> and
      <b><mark>Wil Wheaton</mark></b> are the highlight of the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a 1986 interview with critic <b><mark>Gene Siskel</mark></b
      >,Reiner recalled King telling him,
      <b>"That's the best film ever made out of anything I've written."</b
      ><i>Stand bye Me </i> receives one Oscar nod,for Best Adapted Screenplay.
