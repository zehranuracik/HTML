    <h2>Fun Facts About Horses</h2>
    <h3>1. Horses Can't Breathe Through Their Mouth</h3>
    <p>
      Horses are “obligate nose breathers” meaning that they can only breathe
      through their nose, not through their mouth as humans can.

    <h3>2. Horses Can Sleep Standing Up</h3>
    <p>
      Horses have what’s called a “stay-apparatus” which is a system of tendons
      and ligaments that allows the horse to lock their legs in position so they
      can relax without falling over. When not sleeping, horses also use this
      apparatus to rest while standing for long periods of time so they don’t
      fatigue. This allows them to conserve energy while standing so they are
      ready to take flight if needed. But it is a myth that horses never lay
      down - they do spend a short amount of time each day laying down for
      deeper sleep.

    <h3>3. Horses Have a Nearly 360 Degree Field Of Vision</h3>
    <p>
      This is due to the positioning of their eyes on the sides of their head.
      However, they have two blind spots - one directly behind them, and the
      other just in-front and below their nose. This means that they cannot see
      the grass they are grazing on, or the carrot you are sticking out to them!
      Instead they use their mobile and sensitive lips, whiskers and sense of
      smell to know what is in-front of them and decide if they want to eat it.
